# Invoice Manager

![License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0](https://licensebuttons.net/l/by-nc-nd/4.0/88x31.png)

This project is an Invoice Manager built with Tauri, React, and Typescript using Vite as a build tool. It provides a desktop application to manage invoices, leveraging the power of Tauri for native system interactions and React for building a dynamic user interface.

## âœ¨ Key Technologies

    â€¢	Tauri: Cross-platform application framework using web technologies.
    â€¢	React: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
    â€¢	Typescript: Strictly typed superset of JavaScript.
    â€¢	Vite: Fast development build tool.
    â€¢	TailwindCSS: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
